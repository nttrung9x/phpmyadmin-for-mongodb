# PhpMongoAdmin - Web based MongoDB management written in php using Vue & Laravel
#
# Allows only localhost or private neworks by default: (examples included)
#
# Allowing PhpMongoAdmin to anyone other than localhost should be considered
# dangerous unless properly secured by SSL

#######
# This configuration is meant for creating a Virtual Host implementation
# It is NOT meant to be used for creating a Global install: http://my.ebdomain.com/phpmongoadmin
# For a Global setup use the: setup/apache/global/phpMongoAdmin.conf sample configutation
#
#   Setting up a VirtualHost is not yet supported via a shell script
#

#######
# Creating a Virtual Host installtion requires some planning, due to the many possible location for the application code
# This virtualhost configuration makes the assumption that the default apache web root will be used
# Using this configuration requires the application base to be installed at: /usr/share/phpMongoAdmin
# Here are some viable alternative web root locations:
# - /var/hosting/sites/phpMongoAdmin
# - /home/< user >/phpMongoAdmin
